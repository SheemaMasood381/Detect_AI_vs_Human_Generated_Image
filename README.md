# Detect_AI_vs_Human_Generated_Image

A deep learning-based model to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created images. This repository includes data preprocessing, model training (ConVitX with ConvNeXt Large and Swin Transformer), evaluation using F1-score, and real-time deployment. Built for the Kaggle competition "Can You Tell the Difference?"

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between images generated by AI and those created by humans. This is achieved using a combination of ConvNeXt Large and Swin Transformer architectures, named ConVitX.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by the Kaggle competition "Can You Tell the Difference?". The dataset includes a variety of images, both AI-generated and human-created.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of:
- **ConVitX**: A custom model constructed by combining ConvNeXt Large and Swin Transformer architectures.
- **ConvNeXt Large**: A convolutional network architecture designed for high performance on image classification tasks.
- **Swin Transformer**: A transformer architecture with shifted windows for efficient image processing.

## Training

The model is trained using the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model training with ConVitX
3. Hyperparameter tuning

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the F1-score metric to ensure a balanced measure of precision and recall.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed for real-time image classification, allowing users to input images and receive predictions on whether they are AI-generated or human-created.

## Usage

To use the model for image classification, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SheemaMasood381/Detect_AI_vs_Human_Generated_Image.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the classification script: `python classify_image.py --image_path path_to_image`

## Contributing
